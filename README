# Micro-Frontend Example

This project demonstrates a micro-frontend architecture where multiple independent frontend applications are integrated into a single application. Each micro-frontend is developed, built, and deployed independently.

Imagine that each of the sub-directories are their own repository, for the sake of simplicity they are all included in this one repository.

## Project Structure

- `/home` => code for the dashboard page as a micro frontend

- `/navbar` => code for the navbar component as a micro frontend

- `/posts` => code for the posts page as a micro frontend

- `/products` => code for the products page as a micro frontend

- `/root-config` => code for the root of the micro frontend application that stitches the others together at run-time via single-spa

## Running Locally

Navigate to each repository, install dependencies, then run the start command.

Example:

`cd /home`

`npm i`

`npm run start`

Do so for each repository in order for the `root-config` localhost to be functional.

Navigate to the URL of the root-config local server (http://localhost:9000) to see the application running.
